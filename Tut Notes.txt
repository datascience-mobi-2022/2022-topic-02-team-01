how many metabolic pathways: as much as we can. 40-50 (so we have in total 100 pathways)
from which database: use msigdbr!!!!

try to solve challenge. because you can use scoring function in challenge for geneset scoring.
Challenge: main problem in the big dataset: only have tumour patients only have normal tissues. we cannot compare to normal tissue to find significance.
the challenge is to slice the dataframe into tumourtypes. then enter the dataframes into function. it takeso ne sample and it looks which genes are in my corresponding geneset. returns a p value for the spesific pathway and sample.
repeat for all genesets and all tumour types. you get p value matrix and we get our gene score by getting neg 10 algorithmus? 

inspiration by jackb's code? 
prize ---> food

we have annotation vector. set rownames as sampleID. select rows in the order of sample names and have corresponding tumour type vector. as.factor() gg plot will select color? 

17.30 tuesday in person tutorium. bioquant, lazy cafe etc.

we have technical and biological variation. lil bump in the bottom in var/mean plot phase transition from technical effect to biological effect?

clean TT datasets too

-> check which varience is used for var cleaning qq 25

-> var treshold can be different between bboy and tts

-> make a df of very differing genes and visualize it. myb boxplot. contribution to descriptive analisis. (just have a look)

do challenge.get foods. :)
