## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
View(`PathwayMatrixDeluxePremium (1)`)
Pathway_Matrix=t(`PathwayMatrixDeluxePremium (1)`)
View(Pathway_Matrix)

library(dplyr)
library(Seurat)
library(patchwork)

pbmc <- RunPCA(`PathwayMatrixDeluxePremium (1)`)

DATA=data.frame(pbmc@cell.embeddings)
View(DATA)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot2::ggplot(data =DATA, mapping = aes(x = DATA[, 1], y = DATA[, 2])) + geom_point(alpha = 1.5) 
````
