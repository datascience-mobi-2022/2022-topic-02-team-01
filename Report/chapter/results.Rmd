Figure generation. You can do it with knitr or with latex formatting. This is knitr:

```{r figure1, fig.cap="Title. Description",echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/figure1.png")
```


easier alternative: this is latex formatting. In Figure \ref{figure1} you can see an UMAP. (+ label your figures, equations etc and then reference with /\ref{})

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{figures/figure1.png}
    \caption[\textbf{Title}.]{\textbf{Title}. Description.}
    \label{figure1}
\end{figure}
