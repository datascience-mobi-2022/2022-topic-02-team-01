## 1.1 **Cancer and BRCA** 

Up until this day cancer remains a crucial research topic in the scientific fields. 


\epigraph{Cancer is a disease in which abnormal cells divide without control and can invade nearby tissues.  Cancer cells can also spread to other parts of the body through the blood and lymph systems. There are several main types of cancer.}{\textit{National Cancer Institut \\ at the National Institues of Health}}

In 2020 for industrial countries, e.g., the estimated number of new cancer cases was above 66 thousend cases per country (\ref{Fig 1}).

The focus of this project lies specifically on breast cancer. It is the most common malignant tumor and the second capital reason for cancer death among women worldwide [@L. Wang, S. Zhang and X. Wang, 2021].

Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease resulting from multiple genetic and environmental factors. Underling  those are mutations most commonly in BRCA-1, BRCA-2 and HER-2. 
Mutations in the BRCA1 protein result in DNA damage sensing, cell cycling regulation, E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, chromatin remodeling, and homologous recombination (HR). In contrast, the functional domains of BRCA2 are principally associated with the HR-related proteins, including RAD51 and deleted in split-hand/split foot protein 1 (DSS1). Moreover, double strand breaks that occur as a result of a defective DNA repair system in HR, lead to genomic instability. Which is then favorable for the progression of BRCA-related cancers, especially in the early stages of effective acquisition of sequence and structural changes.[@Y. Hatano *et al.*, 2020].
Among the various breast cancer subtypes, overexpression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 gene is associated with decreased survival and increased recurrence [@P. Petrou, 2019]. The overexpression of Her-2 in the outer membrane of cancer cells  has been a significant therapeutic target for targeted therapy, since it leads to  high aggressiveness, high frequency of brain metastases and poor prognosis [@L. Sitia, *et al.*, 2022].

As seen in \ref{Fig 2} and \ref{Fig 3} it ranks first in new case incidences in a lot of countries in 2020 but also can be considered the top cancer, together with prostate and cervix uteri cancer, worldwide.

Breast cancer can be identified during screening with mammography and clinically classified into four stages depending on the tumour size, if it has formed metastasis or spread to other types of tissues [@Giuliano et al., 2017]. 
Whereas conventional therapies, such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy, are the most common options they usually have limited success. Further, for specifically for patients with high-risk early stage breast cancer neoadjuvant therapy has become standard care [@M. Untch, 2021]. More promising therapy approaches are personalised therapies like immunotherapy, i.e., HER2-targeted therapies [@G. T. Clifton and G. E. Peoples, 2021] or epigenetic therapies. These therapies are a promising tool for overcoming clinical resistance to traditional treatments for breast cancer but are still in the pre-clinical setting and show most promise in use in combinations with other treatments [@L. J. Brown *et al.*, 2022]. 

Especially in the era of personalized medicine and improved genomic analysis using methods of data analysis, i.e., to identify biomarkers for epigenetic therapies, underline the importance of the combined force of computational mathematical analyses via the creation of computer-generated models or simulations and the foundational experimental laboratory. 


## 1.2 **Hallmarks**

\epigraph{The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis.}{\textit{Hallmarks of cancer: the next generation \\ D. Hanahan, R. A. Weinberg, 2011}}
\blindtext

Hallmarks \ref{Fig 4} describe the distinction among tumor and regular cells, comprising six organic abilties received throughout the multistep development of human tumors. Underlying those hallmarks are the "emerging hallmarks" and the "enabling hallmarks" \ref{Fig 4}, like genome instability, which generates the genetic variety that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. 


## 1.3 **Methabolic pathways - ascendany of tumerigenesis** 

An additional core point of our project is the focus on metabolic pathways since metabolic activities are altered in cancer cells relative to normal cells.These reprogrammed activities improve cellular fitness to provide a selective advantage during tumorigenesis. [@Hanahan, D. and Robert, 2011].

Metabolic profiles observed in cancer cells often include increased  glucose and glutamine consumption, increased glycolysis, altered utilization of metabolic enzyme isoforms, and increased lactate secretion. [@H. A. Coller, 2014].

Tumor cells exhibit altered metabolism, as observed by O. Warburg (1920) and more recently, the metabolic changes that occur during cancer are being reconsidered as pivotal to the disease itself.
Important regulators of metabolism are oncogenes and tumor suppressors that are consistently activated or deleted. In example, oncogenic molecules AKT, MYC, and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) can all contribute to the metabolic shifts that occur during carcinogenesis [@H. A. Coller, 2014].

The significant differences in the relative use of different types of energy production in normal cells and tumors, observed by O. Warburg manifests itself in tumor cells during the glycolysis, where pyruvate is mainly converted to lactic acid and energy is produced anaerobically. This phenomena takes place even if there is sufficient oxygen for supporting the mitochondrial function. Hence, the conversion of  pyruvate to lactic acid by fermentation, even in the presence of oxygen, is called aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect.
[@H. A. Coller, 2014]

## 1.4 **Mathmatical Tools** 

In order to perform significant examination of our data we implemented different mathematical tools such as dimensional reduction, wilcoxon test, jaccard index, bonferroni correction and fold change. First we started with computing the variance, defining how far our samples are from the average value, and continued with dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction (UMAP). The goal of PCA is to extract  important information from a data frame and represent it as a new set of orthogonal variables called principal components [@H. Abdi, L. J. Williams, 2010] . In comparison to PCA the UMAP method reduces dimensions of the data nonlinearly, indicating highest reproducibility and the most meaningful organization of cell clusters [@E. Becht *et al.,* 2019]. 
For the comparison of BRCA and other tumor types we computed p-values via Wilcoxon paired test. Wilcoxon paired test is a nonparametric statistical hypothesis used to compare the position of two populations using two matched samples [@W. J. Conover, 1999]. The p-value helps us to estimate the probability of getting a test statistic as large or larger assuming both distributions are the same [H. M. J. Hung *et al.*, 1997]. Since in some cases p-value correction was necessary, we used the Bonferroni method to reduce the chances of obtaining false-positive results (type I errors) when multiple pairwise tests are performed on a single set of data [@J. Ranstam, 2016].
Furthermore, we also used Jaccard index to compare members for two sets to see which members are shared and which are distinct [@S. Fletcher, M. Z. Islam, 2018].  For measuring how much quantity  changes between the original and  subsequent measurements we computed fold change, which is defined as the ratio of the two quantities. [@J. Feng *et al.*, 2012].



## 1.5 **Project outline**

Aiming to investigate the possibility of identifying breast cancer-relevant biomarkers, during the course of this project, we explored the gene expression data of a broad selection of patients in a step-by-step manner summarized in  \ref{Fig 5}. 

We aimed to gradually concentrate the descriptive capacity of our data by data cleaning and dimensional reduction methods, including PCA and UMAP, eventually grouping and collectively scoring genes in the context of pathways by the GSVA method. Afterwards, we compared the respective differential activation scores of several tumor types. Furthermore, we plotted the pathways in the context of p-value and fold change, thus identifying the pathways most relevant to BRCA and tumor progression and possible trends connecting these pathways. With this information, we selected one pathway we hypothesize could be scientifically and clinically relevant as a biomarker. Hence, we built a regression model predicting the behaviour of this pathway by selecting other highly relevant pathways. In conclusion, we propose that further use and optimization of this regression model could lead to the identification of previously unknown interconnections between these pathways, as well as the identification of biomarkers for targeted therapy and diagnostic tools employed in the treatment of breast cancer.
