# Material and Methods

## 2.1 Materials 
### 2.1.1 Data sets 
- tcga + annot 
- 5 cancers 

say that they were provided, dimension before cleaning, what contains (rows, columns), what did we use it for or like what work did we perform with it 
What kind of data do we have?

### Used Packages
show a table! 
- where from 
- what they do 
- what we used them for 

## 2.2 Methods 

### 2.2.1 Data Exploration 

 2.2.1.1 Cleaning & Filtering 
 
 -remobed NAs (why & how) + code chunk + function 
 - biotype filtering (why + how) + function + code chunk 
 
 2.2.1.2 Discriptive analysis
 
- what is this + what is is used for 
- what we did (violin, boxplot, barplot, histos, variance mean, PCA ... What else ????) + plots, Q: do we here need code chunks ?

   Results: what did we acchive with this, what does it say, ow can we use thius inforamtion + in dicussion if needed point out what is interersting and if this needs further research 
   
2.2.2 Metabolic pathways 
  
- how did we find and retrieved the pathways
- where did we extract them form + how  code chunk ?
- for what + what did we d further with them 
 
2.2.3 Gene set scoring 
 
- what is this 
- what used for generally 
- how did we use it + code chunk + what did we get (probs in results, right?) + plotsss + volcano ? 
- quality control ???

######where does venn diagrmm gooooo

### pan cancer 
### GSEA vs GSVA
###correlation analysis 
###regression analysis 


nowww resultsss and info impuut, go sleepyy sleep
