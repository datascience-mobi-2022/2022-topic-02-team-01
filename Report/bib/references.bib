The resulting rich data provide a major opportunity to develop an integrated picture of commonalities, differences and emergent themes across tumor lineages. The Pan-Cancer initiative compares the first 12 tumor types profiled by TCGA. Analysis of the molecular aberrations and their functional roles across tumor types will teach us how to extend therapies effective in one cancer type to others with a similar genomic profile.},

	abstract = {Elongin A is a transcription elongation factor that increases the overall rate of mRNA chain elongation by RNA polymerase II. To investigate the function of Elongin A in vivo, the two alleles of the Elongin A gene have been disrupted by homologous recombination in murine embryonic stem (ES) cells. The Elongin A-deficient ES cells are viable, but show a slow growth phenotype because they undergo a delayed mitosis. The cDNA microarray and RNase protection assay using the wild-type and Elongin A-deficient ES cells indicate that the expression of only a small subset of genes is affected in the mutant cells. Taken together, our results suggest that Elongin A regulates transcription of a subset but not all of genes and reveal a linkage between Elongin A function and cell cycle progression.},

	abstract = {Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancy among women worldwide. Metastasis is mainly responsible for treatment failure and is the cause of most breast cancer deaths. The role of metabolism in the progression and metastasis of breast cancer is gradually being emphasized. However, the regulatory mechanisms that conduce to cancer metastasis by metabolic reprogramming in breast cancer have not been expounded. Breast cancer cells exhibit different metabolic phenotypes depending on their molecular subtypes and metastatic sites. Both intrinsic factors, such as MYC amplification, PIK3CA, and TP53 mutations, and extrinsic factors, such as hypoxia, oxidative stress, and acidosis, contribute to different metabolic reprogramming phenotypes in metastatic breast cancers. Understanding the metabolic mechanisms underlying breast cancer metastasis will provide important clues to develop novel therapeutic approaches for treatment of metastatic breast cancer.},

	abstract = {Human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER-2) overexpressing breast cancer is a breast cancer subtype characterized by high aggressiveness, high frequency of brain metastases and poor prognosis. HER-2, a glycoprotein belonging to the ErbB receptor family, is overexpressed on the outer membrane of cancer cells and has been an important therapeutic target for the development of targeted drugs, such as the monoclonal antibodies trastuzumab and pertuzumab. These therapies have been available in clinics for more than twenty years. However, despite the initial enthusiasm, a major issue emerged limiting HER-2 targeted therapy efficacy, i.e., the evolution of drug resistance, which could be tackled by nanotechnology. The aim of this review is to provide a first critical update on the different types of HER-2-targeted nanoparticles that have been proposed in the literature in the last decade for therapeutic purposes. We focus on the different targeting strategies that have been explored, their relative outcomes and current limitations that still need to be improved. Then, we review the nanotools developed as diagnostic kits, focusing on the most recent techniques, which allow accurate quantification of HER-2 levels in tissues, with the aim of promoting more personalized medicinal approaches in patients.},

@article{Shagufta:2018ws,
	abstract = {Tamoxifen (ICI 46 474), trans-1-(4-β-dimethylaminoethoxyphenyl)-1,2-diphenylbut-1-ene, is the most commonly used drug for the treatment of estrogen receptor positive breast cancer and has been saving lives worldwide for the past four decades. Tamoxifen is considered a pioneering drug due to its ubiquitous use in both treatment and chemoprevention of breast cancer and also for research addressing novel selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). Tamoxifen is cost effective, lifesaving, and devoid of major side effects in the majority of patients. The discovery of tamoxifen metabolites such as 4-hydroxy tamoxifen, N-desmethyl tamoxifen, and endoxifen has facilitated understanding of tamoxifen's and its metabolites' mechanisms of action in breast cancer therapy. Continuous efforts are being made by both industry and academia to synthesize novel tamoxifen derivatives in order to better understand the mechanism of this drug's action and to generate new agents with reduced side effects for many therapeutic targets. This review article comprises the tamoxifen derivatives reported in the literature in the last few years and we anticipate that it will assist medicinal chemists in the synthesis of novel and pharmacologically potent agents for various therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {Cell migration is essential to cancer invasion and metastasis and is spatially and temporally integrated through transcriptionally dependent and independent mechanisms. As cell migration is studied in vitro, it is important to identify genes that both drive cell migration and are biologically relevant in promoting invasion and metastasis in patients with cancer. Here, gene expression profiling and a high-throughput cell migration system answers this question in human bladder cancer. In vitro migration rates of 40 microarray-profiled human bladder cancer cell lines were measured by radial migration assay. Genes whose expression was either directly or inversely associated with cell migration rate were identified and subsequently evaluated for their association with cancer stage in 61 patients. This analysis identified genes known to be associated with cell invasion such as versican, and novel ones, including metallothionein 1E (MT1E) and nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), whose expression correlated positively with cancer cell migration and tumor stage. Using loss of function analysis, we show that MT1E and NNMT are necessary for cancer cell migration. These studies provide a general approach to identify the clinically relevant genes in cancer cell migration and mechanistically implicate two novel genes in this process in human bladder cancer.},

	abstract = {Every cancer carries genomic mutations. Although almost all these mutations arise after fertilization, a minimal count of cancer predisposition mutations are already present at the time of genesis of germ cells. Of the cancer predisposition genes identified to date, BRCA1 and BRCA2 have been determined to be associated with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Such cancer predisposition genes have recently been attracting attention owing to the emergence of molecular genetics, thus, affecting the strategy of cancer prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics. In this review, we summarize the molecular significance of these two BRCA genes. First, we provide a brief history of BRCA1 and BRCA2, including their identification as cancer predisposition genes and recognition as members in the Fanconi anemia pathway. Next, we describe the molecular function and interaction of BRCA proteins, and thereafter, describe the patterns of BRCA dysfunction. Subsequently, we present emerging evidence on mutational signatures to determine the effects of BRCA disorders on the mutational process in cancer cells. Currently, BRCA genes serve as principal targets for clinical molecular oncology, be they germline or sporadic mutations. Moreover, comprehensive cancer genome analyses enable us to not only recognize the current status of the known cancer driver gene mutations but also divulge the past mutational processes and predict the future biological behavior of cancer through the molecular trajectory of genomic alterations.},

@article{Coller:2014wf,
	abstract = {Although cancer has historically been viewed as a disorder of proliferation, recent evidence has suggested that it should also be considered a metabolic disease. Growing tumors rewire their metabolic programs to meet and even exceed the bioenergetic and biosynthetic demands of continuous cell growth. The metabolic profile observed in cancer cells often includes increased consumption of glucose and glutamine, increased glycolysis, changes in the use of metabolic enzyme isoforms, and increased secretion of lactate. Oncogenes and tumor suppressors have been discovered to have roles in cancer-associated changes in metabolism as well. The metabolic profile of tumor cells has been suggested to reflect the rapid proliferative rate. Cancer-associated metabolic changes may also reveal the importance of protection against reactive oxygen species or a role for secreted lactate in the tumor microenvironment. This article reviews recent research in the field of cancer metabolism, raising the following questions: Why do cancer cells shift their metabolism in this way? Are the changes in metabolism in cancer cells a consequence of the changes in proliferation or a driver of cancer progression? Can cancer metabolism be targeted to benefit patients?},

	url = {https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/sciadv.1600200 %X Researchers provide a conceptual framework to understand current knowledge of the fundamentals of cancer metabolism. Tumors reprogram pathways of nutrient acquisition and metabolism to meet the bioenergetic, biosynthetic, and redox demands of malignant cells. These reprogrammed activities are now recognized as hallmarks of cancer, and recent work has uncovered remarkable flexibility in the specific pathways activated by tumor cells to support these key functions. In this perspective, we provide a conceptual framework to understand how and why metabolic reprogramming occurs in tumor cells, and the mechanisms linking altered metabolism to tumorigenesis and metastasis. Understanding these concepts will progressively support the development of new strategies to treat human cancer.},
