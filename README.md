## About our project

In our project we want to explore the genetic origin of tumorigenesis by identifying pathways differentially expressed in cancer patients and specifically breast cancer patients.

## Folder structure

- **Impostor:** Files that we are not sure we need but don't know if we should delete. 
- **Data_Cleaning:** yeeting bad genes
