## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r gene symbol to ID}

library("biomaRt")

ensembl = useMart("ensembl",dataset="hsapiens_gene_ensembl")

x = list ("ID")

for (i in 1:46){
   x$ID[i] =   getBM(attributes=c("ensembl_gene_id") ,mart=ensembl,
  filters= "hgnc_symbol"  , values = genesets$genesets[i])
} 

## attributes: what we wanna retrieve from Biomart 
## value: our datasets -> retrieve ensembl_gene_id from our datasets 

View (x$ID)

## i have here the pathways (all 46 of them) and all the ensemble ID related to the respectively pathway
