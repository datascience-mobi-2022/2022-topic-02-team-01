## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

This chunk allows you to load the datasets and look at the dimensions.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
tcga_exp = readRDS("C:/Users/EKN/Documents/tcga_tumor_log2TPM.RDS")
tcga_annot = readRDS("C:/Users/EKN/Documents/tcga_tumor_annotation.RDS")
tcga_tumor_norm = readRDS("C:/Users/EKN/Documents/tcga_tumor_normal_datascience_proj_2022.RDS")
genesets = readRDS("C:/Users/EKN/Documents/hallmarks_genesets.rds")
dim (tcga_exp)
dim(tcga_annot)
dim (tcga_tumor_norm)
dim(genesets)
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
brca = tcga_tumor_norm[["BRCA"]]
brca.tumor = brca[["tumor"]]
brca.norm = brca[["normal"]]
brca.annot = brca[["clinical"]]
dim(brca.tumor)
dim(brca.norm)
dim(brca.annot)
class(genesets)
names(genesets)
names(genesets$genesets)
## these are the first genes of the first geneset
head(genesets$genesets[[1]])
## the element description contains a description of the genesets
head(genesets$description)
```
