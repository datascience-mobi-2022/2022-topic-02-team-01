```{r compute foldchange}

#log2(TPM)(Transcripts Per Million) refers to how much RNA is present in a sample.
#Log2Foldchange describes how one sample is different from another.

# compute mean gene expression for each condition (normal and tumor)

cancer_mean_vector = apply(SkinnySadTT, 1, mean)

# compute foldchange  log2(FC) = log2(TPMcondition1) - log2(TPMcondition2) = log2(TPMcondition1/TPMcondition2)

#e_normal_mean_vector = 2^normal_mean_vector
#e_cancer_mean_vector = 2^cancer_mean_vector

#foldchange =  e_cancer_mean_vector/e_normal_mean_vector

```{r compute p-values for each genes}

#When identifying differentially expressed (DE) genes from high-throughput gene expression measurements, we would like to take both statistical significance (such as P-value) and biological relevance (such as fold change) into consideration 

# here we calculate p-values for each genes by wilcoxon test
 
 p_value = c()

 for (i in 1:nrow(SkinnyHappyTT)){
  p_value[i] = wilcox.test(unlist(SkinnyHappyTT[i,]),unlist(SkinnySadTT[i,]),paired = TRUE )$p.value
