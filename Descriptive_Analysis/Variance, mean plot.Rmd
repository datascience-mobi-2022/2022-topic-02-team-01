## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

````{r}
tcga_exp = readRDS("C:/Users/joana/Documents/tcga_tumor_log2TPM.RDS")

#This is wrong but for now safe, it might be useful

#Using ggplot
in order to use ggpots you might need rtools for version 4.2 _ https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/
Then install  tidyverse package

```{r}
install.packages("Rcmdr", dependencies = TRUE)
install.packages("tidyverse")
````

````{r}
ncol(mean_tcga_exp)
nrow(variance_tcga_exp)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
variance.and.mean <- merge(mean_tcga_exp, variance_tcga_exp)
variance.and.mean
ggplot(data=variance.and.mean,aes(x=mean_tcga_exp, y=variance_tcga_exp))
```
